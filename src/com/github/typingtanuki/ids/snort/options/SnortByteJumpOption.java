 * The byte_jump keyword allows rules to be written for length encoded protocols trivially. By having an option that
 * reads the length of a portion of data, then skips that far forward in the packet, rules can be written that skip
 * over specific portions of length-encoded protocols and perform detection in very specific locations.
