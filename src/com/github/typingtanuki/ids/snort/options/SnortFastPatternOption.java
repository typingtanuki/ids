 * The fast_pattern keyword is a content modifier that sets the content within a rule to be used with the fast pattern
 * matcher. The default behavior of fast pattern determination is to use the longest HTTP buffer content.
 * If no HTTP buffer is present, then the fast pattern is the longest content. Given this behavior,
 * it is useful if a shorter content is more "unique" than the longer content, meaning the shorter content is less
 * likely to be found in a packet than the longer content.
